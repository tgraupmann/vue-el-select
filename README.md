Vue Select Element Component

* [Binding Issue](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tgraupmann/vue-el-select/blob/master/index.html) has `this` scope issue.

* [Workaround](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tgraupmann/vue-el-select/blob/master/workaround.html) uses `getRoot()` to avoid `this` scope issue.

* [Expected](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tgraupmann/vue-el-select/blob/master/expected.html) this is how it should work with a bind.
